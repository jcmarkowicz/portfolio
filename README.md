### Data Science Projects
- [Boston Violent Crime Analysis](BostonShootingAnalysis.pdf)
  With R studio, I explore Boston police data regarding shooting incidents over the past decade, and by merging census data, I developed several OLS models to explain   
  significant relationships between shooting incidents and socioeconomic factors. I also perform a geospatial weighted regression to align my analysis with the assumptions of 
  OLS.
- [Deep Learning Sentiment Analysis Text+AudioDeep](Final Paper - DS 340.pdf) 
  Using BERT and transformer models, I obtained feature embeddings for labeled text and audio data as inputs to Bidirectional LSTM and Feed Forward Neural Network. The project 
  pdf describes the performance of deep learning in comparison to XGBoost and Logistic Regression.[Project Code](SentimentAnalysisCode.pdf)
- [Delivery Time Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P35NgmgIHbHf4Ywvef-PHm6sno6Z8nV-#scrollTo=mF1rY8m6Mf-7)
  Exploration of classical machine learning techniques with data cleaning and preprocessing with Python. Compared the performance of ensemble 
  and regression models such as random forrest, lasso, ridge, and elastic nets.  
- [Covid-19 Vaccination Completion Forecast](Research Poster.pdf)
  Utilized R posterdown to present regression and exploratory data analysis. Conducted research forecasting vaccination rates based on national and county level voting and 
  demographic data. 
- [Graph Construction and BFS with Rust](https://github.com/jcmarkowicz/BreadthFirstSearchDS210/blob/master/src/main.rs)
  Built a graph data structure using Rust functions and custom data types. Programmed breadth first search 
  algorithm to sucessfully travese a graph 
  with over 10,000 nodes. 
- [PowerBI Sample Dashboards](SampleDashboards.pdf)
